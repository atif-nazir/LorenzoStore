# Lorenzo Store

A modern e-commerce experience for high-performance bikes, built with Next.js
App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project highlights advanced
animations, immersive product showcases, and detailed inquiry/contact flows to
engage riders and collectors.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start the dev server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm dev

# create an optimized production build
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

> Prefer `pnpm`, but `npm`/`yarn` will also work if you update the lockfile
> accordingly.

## Project Structure

- `app/` – routes, layouts, and API handlers using the Next.js App Router
- `components/` – UI building blocks, animations, and shared sections
- `hooks/` & `lib/` – reusable logic (e.g., data fetching, utilities)
- `public/` – static assets such as images and fonts
- `styles/` – Tailwind configuration and global styles

## Tooling

- Next.js 14 with React server components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
